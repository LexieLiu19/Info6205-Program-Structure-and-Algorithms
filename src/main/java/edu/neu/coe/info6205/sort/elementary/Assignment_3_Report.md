## 3. Conclusion:

From the running time observations, we can draw a conclusion: generally,
Insertion sort has the best performance when the array is already sorted. The
time complexity is O(n). When the array is randomly ordered, namely, un-sorted,
the average-time complexity is O(n^2). When the array is reversely sorted, the
running time is even longer. The worst-case of time complexity is O(n^2). When
the array is half-sorted, the time complexity can be anywhere between O(n) and
O(n^2), depending on the distribution of the sorted and unsorted elements.
